# Custom Action Hub Example

This is an example custom action hub that can be used to create a Looker Action Hub server that only includes your own custom actions.

This is useful for building private or proprietary actions, if you'd like to contribute something everyone can use you may contribute it directly to [Looker's Action Hub](https://github.com/looker/actions).
